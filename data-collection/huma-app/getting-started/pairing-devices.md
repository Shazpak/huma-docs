# Pairing devices

**User**: Patient

The key function of the Huma App is for collecting patient data and sharing it with care teams. We try to make that as easy as possible by allowing connected medical devices to be synced via Bluetooth or other automated connectivity methods.

## How it works

Go to your profile and select **Devices**.

Before you can add any devices, you will need to enable Bluetooth. Follow the instructions on screen to give the app permission to access Bluetooth.

Once you have granted Bluetooth permissions, youâ€™ll see a list of devices which are available for pairing. Select the one you want to pair and then follow the instructions click **Next**.

To make sure pairing is successful, keep your device close to your phone while pairing takes place. Follow the steps until you see the **Success** screen.

The device should now appear on your **Paired devices** list. You can add new devices or remove devices from here. You can also sync your data from this page rather than from the Track modules or To do list.
