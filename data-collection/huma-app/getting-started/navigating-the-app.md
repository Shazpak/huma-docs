# Navigating the Huma Care App
**User**: Patient, Helper

The main objective of the Huma Care App is to give patients the ability to record their health data and self-observations so that these can be shared with care teams, helping them to manage their general health and specific conditions.

# How it worksâ€‹

Depending on the Huma Care App configuration, there will be up to four different areas, accessible via the navigation menu at the bottom.

The default homepage is usually the [To do/Timeline](../features/to-dos.md) page. This is where you will see any actionable items assigned to you by the care team, such as appointment requests, Learn content, or modules pending data collection.

The [Track](../features/track-modules.md) page is where you can find a list of all your assigned modules and questionnaires. You can find information about the modules [set specific reminders](../features/setting-reminders.md) for entering your data.

The [Learn](../features/learn.md) area provides further reading and insights. Browse the content in the Learn area at any time or wait for specific recommendations from your care team.
