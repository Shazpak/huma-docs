# Calls and appointments
**User**: Patient

Patients sometimes need additional support from their care team in the form of direct consultation. The Huma Care App facilitates this with the Telemedicine function which permits secure video and audio calls. Care teams can [schedule appointments](../../clinician-portal/telemedicine/scheduling-appointments.md) or [call their patient](../../clinician-portal/telemedicine/calling-patients.md) directly from the Telemedicine section of the Care Portal.

## How it worksâ€‹

When someone from your care team schedules an appointment with you, you will receive a push notification and see a new task on your To do list. If you are happy with the time suggested, click **Accept**. It then becomes a scheduled appointment and you will be contacted at the scheduled time. 

If the proposed schedule is not good for you, you can simply reject it. Your care team will be informed and will propose another schedule.

You can also receive unscheduled calls from your care team which you can choose to accept or reject directly. If you reject a call or miss it for some other reason, you will receive a missed call notification

Video calls take place in the Huma Care App without the need for any additional technology. The functionality is very simple:
- The camera icon is used to start and stop the camera 
- The microphone icon is used to mute and unmute the mic 
- The button with the arrow lets you swap between the front-facing and rear-facing camera 
- The red phone button ends the call

Once the call has started, these buttons will disappear but can be brought back by tapping the screen.

You can find all your past and scheduled appointments in the **Appointments** section of your **Profile**. Missed calls will also be logged here.
