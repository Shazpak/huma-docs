# Setting reminders
**User**: Patient, Helper

The key function of the Huma App is for collecting patient data and sharing it with care teams. Regular data entry is key to providing the care team with adequate information for optimal care. The **reminders** functionality allows patients to set up custom notifications so that they don’t have to remember when and which data to enter into the Huma App.

## How it works​

Module tiles will indicate when and how often you should enter data. Setting a reminder for yourself is simple:
1. Open the module or questionnaire and click **+Add reminder**.
2. In the **Set reminder** pop-up, select either a **daily, weekly** or **monthly** reminder.
3. Choose the time you want to receive the notiication.
4. Click **Save**.

The reminder will be logged within the module and you will receive a push notification at the time and frequency selected to remind you to submit your data. 

You can edit your reminder at any time. Just click **Edit** to change the time/frequency or to delete the reminder altogether.
