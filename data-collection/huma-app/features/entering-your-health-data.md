# Entering your health data
**User**: Patient, Helper

The key function of the Huma App is for collecting patient data and sharing it with care teams. Patients will be reminded via their to do list of data they need to add and can also enter it, as needed, by looking for the module on the Track page.

## How it works​

The **Track** screen is accessed via the ![Track](../assets/TrackIcon.png) icon on the navigation menu.

The exact modules and questionnaires on the Track page will depend on the Deployment configuration and are shown as a list of tiles which the patient can view by scrolling. 

Select the module you want to add your data for and click the **Add** button. 

Depending on the type of data being collected you will have the choice of entering it manually, using the camera on your phone or syncing from a connected device.

### Adding data manually

To add data manually, just click the **Add** button and enter the data by inputting it to the text field. The date and time will be automatically set to the current date and time and this should match the time the data was taken. If the data was taken previous to data entry, make sure you set the date and time to match.

### Adding data using the camera

Some health vitals can be collected using the camera on your phone. For example, heart rate can be taken by placing your finger over the camera lens. Open the module and select **Collect from camera** then simply follow the instructions to take your reading. Once complete, it will be recorded automatically with the date and time.

Make sure your [device is paired](../getting-started/pairing-devices.md) and Bluetooth turned on then open the module or click the item from your to do list.

On the module page, select the option **Take and sync your reading**.
