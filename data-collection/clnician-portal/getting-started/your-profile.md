# Your Profile
**User**: Admin; Deployment Staff; Organisation Staff;

Once you have created an account in the Huma Portal, Huma lets you manage your personal data, change your password, edit units of measurement used in the portal and access terms and conditions documents.
## How it works​
Click the button with your name on it at the top right and select **Profile** from the dropdown menu.

### Personal Details
Edit the name as it is shown on the interface to colleagues and patients.

### Contact Information
You can edit your mobile number that is used as part of the 2-factor authentication process. Don’t forget to include the area code in your phone number. Your email is set as your username so that cannot be modified.

The units you choose will only apply to your portal, independent of the preferences of your patients or other colleagues.
