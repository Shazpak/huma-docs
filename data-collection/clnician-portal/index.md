# Care Portal

The Care Portal is the place where care and research teams can view and track patient data. 

Huma provides care teams with tools and information to support and improve patients care, helping them to identify patients in need of support and input.

Key to the Care Portal is the [Patient List](./managing-patients/patient-list.md) which displays all patients along with their module data. Further detail can be found on the [Patient Dashboard](./managing-health-data/patient-dashboard.md), where care teams can also call and message their patients. 
## Users
User roles can be managed from the portal, with a variety of permissions available for all types of user.
Organisation Staff will be able to manage multiple Deployments from within the Care Portal.
