# Roles and permissions

The Cilnician Portal has a number of different [user roles](./default-roles-and-permissions.md) available so that users can only access or edit what they need to. [Custom roles](./creating-custom-roles.md) can also be created with any combination of permissions.

This section will explain these different roles and how to invite both [staff](./inviting-staff-and-assigning-roles.md) and [patients](./inviting-patients.md).
