# Huma’s History and Collaboration Philosophy

Founded in 2011, Huma is a global healthcare AI company dedicated to accelerating the adoption of digital solutions in care and research. Our mission is to enhance patient outcomes through innovative technology, enabling better health management and personalised care. With a strong foundation in AI- driven diagnostics, remote patient monitoring, and comprehensive data analytics, Huma provides a platform that is both versatile and powerful, catering to the diverse needs of the healthcare industry.

Huma’s modular platforms are used by more than 3,000 hospitals and clinics, of which more than 2,000 are bidirectionally integrated. Huma has over 30 million screened users and 1.8 million active users across care use cases, and about 1 million participants across research. Huma has a strong geographical presence and partnership with health systems, governments and clinics with a focus in the US, UK, Germany, Greece and the Middle East, and is also well known for leading some of the largest national projects across some of these countries. Fourteen out of the top twenty pharmaceutical companies are existing clients using Huma for various use cases. Some of the use cases include:

- Multi-channel patient engagement at population-wide scale for healthcare systems
- Remote patient monitoring at scale
- Companion apps to support patients through treatment and drug therapies
- Digital clinical trials, including decentralised trials, to accelerate medical research

Huma launched the Huma Cloud Platform on the back of its own experience scaling digital health solutions in the past decade. Huma Cloud Platform offers no-code configuration of regulated disease management tools for any therapeutic area, along with a library of pre-built modules and device connectivity capabilities. It offers a cloud-agnostic framework for flexible hosting, readily available APIs and integration capabilities and the ability to host and deploy diagnostic and predictive AI algorithms. Additionally, it features a marketplace and more to advance digital-first care and research.

Our collaboration philosophy with Life Sciences partners is to focus on launching products that are cost effective, value-add and differentiated to patients and all stakeholders. We work closely with our partners to understand their needs.

We understand that there are different needs in the industry, and our Life Sciences partners are constantly considering buy vs build. Huma Cloud Platform offers a middle ground, where Life Sciences partners no longer have to choose between buy vs build. Instead, our partners can leverage the Huma tech stack and supplement it with additional features required by way of plugins or widgets rather than having to build the full tech stack from scratch. 

# Overview of Huma Cloud Platform 

Huma Cloud Platform supports the development journey and scale of your ecosystem’s reach. Huma Cloud Platform provides a cohesive and compliant frontend and backend solution for health and wellness applications in regulated environments.

The modularity of the Huma Cloud Platform ensures that features built for you are reusable and can continuously be optimised according to the success metrics defined by your product and design team. By leveraging the full capabilities of the Huma Cloud Platform, you can streamline the creation, testing, and deployment of your digital health solutions, ensuring rapid learning and market responsiveness.

Huma Cloud Platform is built on a cloud-agnostic infrastructure that supports major cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. This ensures your applications are not only scalable and reliable but also flexible enough to integrate with various cloud services as needed. The platform's comprehensive suite of tools includes a REST API, SDK, plugins, and widgets, which provide all the necessary components to build, customise, and enhance applications efficiently.

The platform supports a wide range of built-in and custom plugins, allowing you to quickly implement core functionalities such as health assessments, personalised health plans, symptom tracking, and AI-powered diagnostics. The flexibility of the Huma Cloud’s plugin system means that new services can be added with minimal effort, from low-level infrastructure provisioning to high-level UI widgets. The infrastructure provisioning plugins support database management, storage solutions, and compute resource allocation,
ensuring robust backend services.

Huma’s vision with the Huma Cloud Platform is to create a marketplace, enabling other health solutions (e.g., symptom checkers, precision diagnostic tools, digital Tx, devices) to be integrated into the marketplace overtime, allowing Huma’s partners who are using the Huma Cloud Platform to easily choose relevant providers for its deployment without the challenge of development or integration should that be the preferred way later down the line.
