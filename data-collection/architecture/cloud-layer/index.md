title: Cloud Providers Layer
---

The foundational layer of the Huma Platform is the Cloud Providers Layer. This layer supports multiple cloud environments, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. By leveraging these major cloud providers, the platform ensures high availability, reliability, and scalability. The cloud-agnostic design allows you to deploy and manage applications across different cloud environments without being locked into a single provider, offering flexibility and resilience. This multi-cloud strategy enables you to optimise costs, enhance performance, and meet regional compliance requirements effectively.
