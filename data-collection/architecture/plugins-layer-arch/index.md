title: SDK and Plugins Layer 
---

The SDK and Plugins Layer is critical for extending the platformâ€™s capabilities and integrating custom
functionalities. This layer includes:

- **REST API and SDKs**: Provides developers with libraries and tools to build, customise, integrate and
enhance applications efficiently. Currently Huma SDKs are available for native mobile app development
in Swift and Kotlin. Python client libraries are being developed and more languages will be added
going forward.

- **Custom and Pre-Built Plugins**: A wide range of plugins are available to use out of the box, and the
SDKs allow for the quick implementation of new plugins with specific functionalities, such as ecommerce integration, personalised health plans, and AI-powered diagnostics. Each of these plugins
can add various types of building blocks, including UI widgets, device integrations, and third-party
service integrations, to the apps through SDKs.
