The Services Layer provides functionalities that form the core of the platform's capabilities, extending beyond health management. Developers can create services in any programming language and deploy them as Docker images using Huma Cloud Compose. This ensures consistent deployment, management, and performance within the same infrastructure. Services can include various functionalities such as Authentication Services, Vital Collection, AI-Powered Diagnostics, Medication Tracking, and Integration Services.

Using Huma Cloud Compose, developers can easily build, deploy, and manage these services without worrying about scaling. The platform automatically handles scaling and integrates seamlessly with the managed infrastructure, such as databases and storage, from the lower layers of the platform. This allows for efficient resource management and ensures robust performance.
