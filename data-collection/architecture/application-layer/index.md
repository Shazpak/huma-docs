This is where the user-facing components sit - including web portals and all mobile apps which are using the Huma app builder. 

The no-code app builder is a standout feature of the Huma Cloud Platform, enabling your teams to rapidly prototype, test, and deploy applications without extensive coding. This GenAI-powered, modular platform provides a wide range of pre-built templates, widgets, and features that are easily customisable. Users can start with a template, design the app interface, set up profile pages, add articles and media, integrate Huma Cloud Platform - High-level Architecture Private & Confidential connected devices, and preview the app - all with no technical effort. The Huma Builder supports quick app development, testing, design, and marketing, ensuring rapid learning and efficient MVP development. 

Huma's own applications are also built using the same underlying technology and platform, but each instance is isolated and dedicated, ensuring effortless maintenance and support without any overlap in data or resources. The platformâ€™s capabilities facilitate rapid learning and MVP development. 

You can quickly develop and launch new health applications, gather user feedback, and iterate on the design to improve the product. This approach aligns with best practices in product development, ensuring that the solutions are marketready and meet the users' needs effectively.
