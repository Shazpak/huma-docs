# Inviting staff to an Organisation
**User**: Super Admin, Huma Support, Account Manager, Organisation Owner, Organisation Editor
 
Once a new Organisation has been created, other users can be assigned to manage or edit it and invite other users.

## How it works​
In the Admin Portal, go to the **Organisations** tab and open the dropdown menu on the row that you want to invite users to and click **Invite staff**.

A pop-out window will appear where you can add the email addresses of the people you want to invite. Click **Send invites** to send out your email invitations.

Select the type of role you want to assign from the dropdown:
- **Organisation Editor** – this Admin Portal user can create and edit Deployments within this Organisation and invite other staff members
- **Organisation Owner** – this Admin Portal user can do everything an Organisation Editor can do and can also delete the Organisation
- **Access Controller** – this role is specifically for adding and removing Organisation Staff members and managing roles in the Clinician Portal

For more information on what each user can do, see the article on [Roles and permissions](../../clinician-portal/roles-and-permissions/default-roles-and-permissions.md).

Finally, you can choose how long your invitation will remain active. Click the link after 'Invites expire in' to open the dropdown and choose from 24 hours, 72 hours or 7 days.

Click **Send invites** and the user will receive an email invitation with the link that will let them access the relevant portal.
