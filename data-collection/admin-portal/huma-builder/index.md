# Create a new app
 
Once you have created your Huma account, you will be able to create a new app using the Huma Builder. In general, there are 6 steps you can follow to ensure your app is ready to go. We suggest you create a quick test app first before launching your real app and inviting users to it.

  <strong>What is the Huma Builder?</strong><br/>
  <span>The Huma Builder is a GenAI-powered, modular platform for app creation. This no-code solution lets enterprises, small businesses, and practices develop regulated health apps. It offers a wide range of pre-built templates, widgets, and features that are easily customizable. Huma Builder provides the infrastructure to build custom health apps with minimal technical effort.

For your test app, follow these 7 steps in the Huma Builder:

1. Start with a template
2. Design the app interface 
3. Set up the profile page
4. Add articles and media 
5. Add connected devices
6. Edit app settings
7. Preview your app

## Step 1: Start with a template

Huma Builder Templates are designed to streamline your app creation right from the start - no matter what type of app you are creating. Select from a variety of pre-built templates that can be easily customised. All you have to do is select a template and edit the existing components and app interface. Follow the steps below for a headstart to building your first app:

1. Navigate to <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>My apps</span> in the side panel of the Huma Builder. 
2. Click <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Create</span>.
3. Pick any template to start with. If you do not see a suitable template for your app, select the template <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Huma Demo</span>.

Alternatively, you can start with a blank page. A page equals a tab on the navigation menu of the Huma Care App. When starting with a blank page, you will be asked to enter the page details. For more information, see the below section "Step 2: Design the app interface".

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent', border: '1px solid #297A7A', borderBottomWidth: '3px', borderRightWidth: '3px', padding: '10px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '10px' }}>

</div>

## Step 2: Design the app interface

Once you have selected a template, you will see different pages of your app. Select any page to start designing and editing its contents. Follow the steps below to design your app interface.

### Editing page details

Each page that is shown in the app overview will appear in the bottom navigation of the Huma Care App. Once the app user signs into the app, each page is introduced with a small tutorial. Follow the steps below to change the page details:

1. Click the small gear icon next to the page name.
2. Edit all fields that appear in the modal. The text in the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Description</span> field will appear in the onboarding tutorial once a user onboards to the app.
3. Save your settings.

### Adding, editing and removing widgets

Widgets are functional building blocks of the Huma Care App that can be added, edited, and rearranged in any desired way to create an interface of the app. 

1. Add widgets by clicking <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>+ New widget</span> in the left side panel.
2. Configure the layout or functionality of a widget in the side panel on the right. 
3. Change the order of widgets by dragging the 6 dots of a widget card to the desired position.
4. Remove or reset widget settings to their default by selecting the three dots of each widget card on the left-hand side panel.
5. Click <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Save changes</span> to save your progress.

## Step 3: Creating app content

The Huma Builder CMS is a powerful content management system designed to simplify the creation of articles, videos, and other assets. This user-friendly platform enables you to add, edit, and organise content within your app, ensuring it reaches the right users at the right time. Follow the steps below to add a new article to your app:

1. Select the app that you want to add content to.
2. Access the CMS by clicking the collection icon.
3. Click <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Create</span> to add another article.
4. Skip the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Content ID</span> field. This field will be auto-populated once you save your new article. 
5. Add the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Title</span>, upload the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Feature image</span> that will appear in the app, and select the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Article type</span>. 
6. In the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Body</span> section, add the main content of your article. You can use formatting tools to style your text, add headings, lists, quotes, and links. 
7. Add <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Tags</span> which will help you find articles more easily once you decide where to place your content in your app.
8. Click <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Save changes</span> to save your edits.

  <strong>Tip: Adding external URLs or media as an article type</strong><br/>
  <span>If your article type is an external URL, add your external resource by entering the URL in the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>External URL</span> field. If your article type is a media asset, such as an image or video, add your asset by clicking the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Media</span> button under the Body section.</span>
</div>

### Add assets

Assets like images and videos can be uploaded to visually enhance your articles and make them more engaging for your users.

### Adding content to your app
 
Once you have created a few content pieces, you can start adding those to the desired pages of your app. 

1. Go to the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Builder</span> page. Select the page of your app that you want to add content to. 
2. Click <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>+ New widget</span> in the left side panel, then scroll

### Content sources

- <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>All articles</span> will show all content pieces available in the CMS. 
- <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Filter by tags</span> allows you to add content with specific tags. 
- <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Manual list</span> allows you to search and add available content in the CMS.

## Step 4: Set up the app profile page

The profile page of the app displays the user account information. It allows users to view and edit their personal information and account settings. If you selected an app template, you will find the profile page in the app overview. 

[ADD IMAGE]

In the right-hand panel, you can edit the configuration of the profile page. Click the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Edit configuration</span> button to select which profile fields, IDs, contact details, gender options, and onboarding fields will be shown in the app. You can also add <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Custom fields</span> that you would like your users to enter in their profile page. After editing the configuration of your profile page, click <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Save changes</span>.

[ADD IMAGE]

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent', border: '1px solid #297A7A', borderBottomWidth: '3px', borderRightWidth: '3px', padding: '10px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '10px' }}>
  <strong>Tip: Adding a new profile page from scratch</strong><br/>
  <span>If you did not start building your app using a template, create a new page. You can call that page "Profile" and select the profile icon so it will be clear to the user what they can expect when clicking on that page. Once you are in that page, click <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>+ New widget</span> and scroll down to <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Profile (Full page)</span>. Since this is a full-page widget spanning the entire page, you won't be able to select any other widget in addition to the profile.</span>
</div>

[ADD IMAGE]

### Enable appointments

On your profile page, you can enable a range of features shown in the right side panel. In addition to the default options, you can also toggle on <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Appointments</span>. Enabling this feature will allow app users and clinicians using the Huma Care Portal to schedule appointments and join virtual calls on Huma. 

### Lock app

Enabling <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Lock app</span> in the right-side panel of the profile page adds an extra layer of security for users. This feature requires users to enter their passcode every time they access the app, even if they remain signed in.

## Step 5: Add connected devices

## Step 6: Edit app settings

The settings section in the Huma Builder allows you to customise your app further. You can change the name, logo, language, default units, and legal documents. To make these edits, select the app you wish to modify, and navigate to the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Settings</span> page in the navigation menu.

## Step 7: Preview your app

You can preview your app at any time during your editing process. Select the app you want to preview, and click on the phone icon at the bottom of the navigation bar.
