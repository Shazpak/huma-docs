# Managing Deployments

Deployments are unique platform configurations that you can create within each Organisation to suit different patient cohorts or project objectives.

In this section you will find out how to [create a new Deployment](./general-settings/creating-a-new-Deployment.md), configure all elements of the Deployment, including the [App features](./general-settings/app-features.md), [user onboarding](./configuring-the-user-onboarding/onboarding-setup.md), [user profile](./configuring-the-user-profile/user-profile-details.md) and the [content](./configuring-the-content/index.md). You will also learn how to [invite staff](./tools-and-navigation/inviting-deployment-admins.md) to manage the Deployment, plus all the other [tools](./tools-and-navigation/index.md) and [settings](./general-settings/index.md) that you need to be familiar with to manage your Deployments.
