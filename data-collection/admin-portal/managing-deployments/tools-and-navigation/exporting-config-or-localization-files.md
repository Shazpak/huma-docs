# Exporting the configuration or localisation files
**User**: Super Admin, Huma Support, Account Manager, Organisation Owner, Organisation Editor

Once you have configured a new Deployment, you can export a JSON file of the full configuration so that you can recreate it in the future or in order to integrate it with another tool. 
You can also export a different JSON containing all the copy from your Deployment so that you can translate it. 
## How it works
In the Admin Portal, find your list of Deployments on the **Deployments** tab. Open the dropdown menu at the end of the row and select **Export JSON** or **Generate file to translate** depending on whether you want the full code for the Deployment or just the content to be translated.

A file will be downloaded to your device in JSON. The localisation file can be reuploaded in the Languages section of the **App Configuration**.
>
> ðŸ›‘ **IMPORTANT**: In the case of the localisation file, please note that once you have downloaded it, your Deployment configuration will be locked and you wonâ€™t be able to make any changes. For the full procedure, please refer to [this documentation](https://humatherapeutics.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DO/pages/3298689083/How-To+Log+a+Translation+Request).
