# Deployment preview
**User**: Super Admin, Huma Support, Account Manager, Organisation Owner, Organisation Editor


This can be done both for the Huma App and the Clinician Portal. 
## How it works
### Previewing the Huma App​
Go to the Deployment you want to preview. You’ll see a ![Preview](./assets/Preview.png) icon at the bottom right of the screen (you can find this on any page within the Deployment management screens).

Click the icon and a QR code will appear for you to scan with your phone. Make sure you already have the [demo version of the Huma App](https://humatherapeutics.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HUM/pages/2155413529/.RPM+-+Patient+App+and+Clinician+Portal+Demo) installed and that you are signed out of the Huma App.

Click the link that appears on your phone and this will take you to the sign-up screen. The process is the same as when you sign up using a link.

Review the onboarding process and the rest of the experience and make any changes to the configuration as needed.
### Previewing the Clinician Portal
To preview how the Clinician Portal looks for your Deployment, just [invite yourself as an Admin](./inviting-deployment-admins.md) or [Access Controller (Organization)](../../managing-organisations/inviting-staff-to-an-organisation.md).
