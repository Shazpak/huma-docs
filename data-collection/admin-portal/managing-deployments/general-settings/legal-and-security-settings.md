# Legal and security settings
**User**: Super Admin, Huma Support, Account Manager, Organisation Owner, Organisation Editor.

Huma takes security seriously and uses 2-factor authentication to log users in. The user is first authenticated with their password and then via a verification code sent to their mobile. This adds an extra layer of protection in the event of a compromised password.

Users should be able to access a privacy policy, EULA and T&Cs with each Deployment. These can also be part of your onboarding if needed.
## How it worksâ€‹
When configuring a new Deployment, you can set up authentication and legal documents in the **Deployment config** tab.

### Authentication
In the **Deployment config** settings, ensure the **Multi-factor authentication** checkbox is checked.

> 
> ðŸ›‘ **IMPORTANT**: In line with data protection regulations, you should not disable multi-factor authentication on the Clinician Portal, as it contains patient data.   

Patients can turn 2-step authentication on or off using a toggle in the account settings on the **Profile** page. 

Huma also offers the possibility of biometric login using fingerprints or facial recognition. This avoids issues with users forgetting passwords. Patients can activate biometric data when setting up two-step verification. The data requested will depend on the functionality of the device they are using to access the Huma App.

### Legal Documents
In this area, you can upload or link to your legal documents: **Privacy policy**, **End-User Licence Agreement (EULA)** and **Terms and conditions** (the same link as the  EULA) are the documents that should be included. You can choose between **URL** and **Upload**. If using the URL option, add links to these pages on your website or wherever they are located. If using the **Upload** option, click the file icon at the end of each line to upload your documents.
