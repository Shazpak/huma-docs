# Data consent
**User**: Super Admin, Huma Support, Account Manager, Organisation Owner, Organisation Editor

As the Huma platform processes patient data, itâ€™s important to let them know how that data is treated so that they can give their consent. There are three data consent onboarding modules within the Huma platform that can be configured to the needs of the Organisation. The information you enter here, as well as appearing in the onboarding module, will be accessible to users view links on their Profile page.  

Note that the [eConsent](./econsent.md) module is specifically for patients participating in clinical trials and is required for compliance.
## How it worksâ€‹
When creating a new Deployment, you can add the **Consent** module by selecting either **Consent or Legitimate Interest**, or by using the **Empty Consent Template** to start from scratch. Please consult Huma's legal team (legal@huma.com) to determine which is appropriate for your Organisation.

Whichever option you choose, it will be listed in the onboarding modules as **Consent**. Consent modules are configured in English (as indicated by â€˜UKâ€™) but the template can be configured for other languages.

Click the ![Edit](./assets/Edit.png) icon at the end of the row to configure the module.

> ðŸ“˜ Note that the details may vary depending on the country. For the purpose of this guide, we will look at the configuration needed for EU regions who are regulated by GDPR guidelines.

### General
This section specifies the user who needs to consent. In this case, as it is the userâ€™s data being processed, only **User** should be checked.

### Signature
Check the signature box if user signature is required. For each field, you can edit the placeholder text or leave it as the default.

- **Has middle name** - Check this if you want to include a middle name as part of the signature. 
- **Show first last name** - Ensure this is checked so user name and surname is requested.

### Sections
The sections listed in the consent module can be edited, removed and added to in order to configure the module to your specifications. Just click the ![Edit](./assets/Edit.png) icon at the end of the row to change the **Type**, **Title** and **Details** of the section. You can add more sections to your consent form if needed. Click the **Add section** button and complete the details in the pop-out window.

The sections you add to your consent policy are up to you. The section types we have included on the list can be used as a guide but you can customise them with your own title and details.
