# Create a new app
 
Once you have created your Huma account, you will be able to create a new app using the Huma Builder. In general, there are 6 steps you can follow to ensure your app is ready to go. We suggest you create a quick test app first before launching your real app and inviting users to it. 

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent', border: '1px solid #297A7A', borderBottomWidth: '3px', borderRightWidth: '3px', padding: '10px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '10px' }}>
