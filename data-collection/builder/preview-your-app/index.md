title: Preview your app
---
You can preview your app at any time during your editing process. Select the app you want to preview, and click on the phone icon at the bottom of the navigation bar. 


To preview your app, scan the QR code with your mobile phone. If you haven't downloaded the app from the App Store or Google Play yet, you'll be prompted to do so first. Once the Huma Care App is installed on your phone, you can preview your customised app.
