Huma app builder has a **Hybrid** approach to localization and translation.

1. **Huma-managed texts**: Some texts, such as licensed questionnaires, static texts within the app, and more, are
   handled by Huma. Huma will take care of their translation.
2. **Widget-specific texts**: You are responsible for translating the texts you configure in your widgets via the
   localization section in the settings.

    - Any text you configure in your panel like the title and description here:

      ![alt text](<../assets/localization-builder-config.png>)
    - Will appear in the localization settings of your app. Go to the settings and switch to the localization tab:

      ![alt text](<../assets/localization-settings.png>)
    - Add a new language you want to add support for

      ![alt text](<../assets/localization-new-lang.png>)
    - Start translating, Then if your user has their selected language (OS language) set in the selected language they
      will see your localization instead:

      ![alt text](<../assets/localization-localize.png>)
    - Once done click save, and preview the changes in the app.

> **INFO**: Any missing localization will default to your **app default language**.
