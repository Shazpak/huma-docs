Huma app builder has a **Hybrid** approach to localization and translation.

1. There are texts that are managed by Huma like for licensed questionnaires, static texts inside the app and lot more
   which Huma will take care of their translation
2. Your configuration inside widgets, so You can translate the texts you configure in your widgets in the localization
   section inside the setting

    - Any Text you configure in your panel like the title and description here
   
      ![alt text](<../assets/localization-builder-config.png>)
    - Will show up in your localization setting withing your app so head onto the settings and switch to the
      localization tab
    
      ![alt text](<../assets/localization-settings.png>)
    - Add a new language you want to add support for 
      
      ![alt text](<../assets/localization-new-lang.png>)
    - Start translating, Then if your user has their OS language set in the selected language they will see your
      localization instead
    
      ![alt text](<../assets/localization-localize.png>)
    - Once done click save.

> ⚠️ **INFO**: Any missing localization will default to your **app default language**.
