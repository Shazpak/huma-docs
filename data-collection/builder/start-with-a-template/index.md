## Step 1: Start with a template

Huma Builder Templates are designed to streamline your app creation right from the start - no matter what type of app you are creating. Select from a variety of pre-built templates that can be easily customised. All you have to do is select a template and edit the existing components and app interface. Follow the steps below for a headstart to building your first app:

1. Navigate to <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>My apps</span> in the side panel of the Huma Builder. 
2. Click <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Create</span>.
3. Pick any template to start with. If you do not see a suitable template for your app, select the template <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#EBEBEB', padding: '0 5px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>Huma Demo</span>. 


Alternatively, you can start with a blank page. A page equals a tab on the navigation menu of the Huma Care App. When starting with a blank page, you will be asked to enter the page details. For more information, see the below section "Step 2: Design the app interface".

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent', border: '1px solid #297A7A', borderBottomWidth: '3px', borderRightWidth: '3px', padding: '10px', borderRadius: '5px', marginBottom: '10px' }}>
