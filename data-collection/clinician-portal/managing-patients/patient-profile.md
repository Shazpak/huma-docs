# Patient Profile

## How it worksâ€‹
On the **Patient Overview**, select the ![Patient Profile](./assets/Profile.png) tab.

The Patient Profile can be [configured from the Admin Portal](../../admin-portal/managing-deployments/configuring-the-user-profile/user-profile-details.md) and this will determine what fields are available. Some of the default information includes personal and account details and identification information. Other fields, such as medical history, surgeries or medication can be included as needed and managed here.

If your role allows it, click the ![Edit](./assets/Edit.png) button to edit the patient details. When you have made changes, click the ![Check](./assets/Tick.png) icon to save or the ![Cross](./assets/Cross.png) to revert back.
