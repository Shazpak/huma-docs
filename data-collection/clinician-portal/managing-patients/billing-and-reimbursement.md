# Billing and reimbursement
**User**: Admin; Access Controller; Deployment Staff; Contributor; Organisation Staff
The billing module enables medical service providers to invoice remote patient interactions. Clinicians can onboard patients, record a timestamp on their dashboard, track services provided against RTM and RPM codes, and export patient clinical summary data with billing information. 

This module is available for US clients only.
## How it works
On the Patient List, find the patient you want to onboard, open the menu and click Enroll for billing. In the billing details window, enter the insurance carrier(s), the billing provider and the primary diagnosis.
