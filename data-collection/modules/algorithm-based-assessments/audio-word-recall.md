title: Audio Word Recall (RAVLT)
---

The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) provides a standardised procedure to evaluate a range of aspects of verbal learning and memory of supra-span lists of words.

## How it works

### Patients

The patient will be asked to listen to a list of words that will be read out loud to them. They will then have to repeat back as many words as they can remember from the list, speaking clearly into their phone. This cycle will be repeated several times with the patient being led through the process with clear step-by-step instructions.

The aim of the test is to find the patient's recall limits and they would not usually be expected to be able to recall every word from all the lists.

### Clinicians

This module provides a useful activity to help patients test and improve their powers of word recall. Results are only visible to themselves and not to their care team.
