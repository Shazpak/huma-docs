title: Bespoke Questionnaire
---

Huma enables care teams to collect important health data for remote patient monitoring to help them advise and make decisions about their patients' healthcare plan. Typically used for non-licensed questionnaires, bespoke questionnaires allow care teams to collect answers to health questions using free text, numerical input, multiple choice and other standard question types.

## How it works
From the Huma App, patients enter their health data into the questionnaire according to a schedule as presented to the patient via tasks on To-do. If available, patients can enter their health data into the questionnaire as needed via Track and the Questionnaire module. 

This data is displayed for care teams within the Clinician Portal. Care teams need to click into the Questionnaire module where it lists all bespoke questionnaires and then click into the bespoke questionnaire of choice to see all the answers against each question.
