title: Medication Tracker
---

Patients may be taking medications associated to another care plan that should be shared with their care team. The Medication Tracker module allows patients to make a log of medications and track how they are responding.

## How it works

The Medication Tracker presents patients with an adherence questionnaire which asks them to what extent they have stuck to their medication plan and how they have responded to it. The tracker also pulls data from the [Medication module](./medications.md) although patients can also add their medication in this module.

The time and date is added automatically at the moment they make the entry (although this can be edited if needed) and patients will be able to view all their previous entries from within the module. Patients can also set reminders to help them stay on track.

In the Patient Summary, care teams will be able to see the patient's latest entries.

The detailed view shows all the patient's historic data in table form.
