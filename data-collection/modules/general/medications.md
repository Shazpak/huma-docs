Patients may be taking medications associated to another care plan that should be shared with their care team. The Medications module allows patients to make a log of the medications they are taking along with their dosage and frequency.

## How it works

Patients enter the names of any medications they are taking plus the dosage and frequency. Patients can use this module alongside the 
[Medication Tracker](./medication-tracker.md) module if needed view their Medications added, as well as change or delete them as necessary. This can be used in conjunction with the

The time and date is added automatically at the moment they make the entry (although this can be edited if needed) and patients will be able to view all their previous entries from within the module. Patients can also set reminders to help them stay on track.

In the Patient Summary, care teams will be able to see the patient's latest entries.
