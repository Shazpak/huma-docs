Huma enables care teams to collect important health data for remote patient monitoring to help them advise and make decisions about their patients' healthcare plan. The following modules record different data points which are either input manually by the patient or using devices that are synced with the Huma App.

## How it works

From the Huma App, patients enter their health data into the module according to the schedule indicated - setting reminders to help them with this schedule if needed. Historic data showing trends in the patient's evolution is also available to view in some of the modules. 

This data is displayed for care teams within the Huma Portal, with anomalous or concerning data highlighted to aid with prioritisation. Care teams can then feed back to the patient with their observations and recommendations.
