A Breezometer can be used to test the air quality of the surrounding environment. This is important for asthma/COPD patients to track as it can affect their day-to-day lives.

## How it works

By entering their location, patients get detailed information about the air quality, pollen count, and weather condition in order to track how air quality affects a patient’s other symptoms.

This module integrates with the Breezometer to provide detailed information about the next three days’ conditions:
- **Air quality** - This is given as a score out of 100 and a colour indicator for the upcoming hourly condition 
- **Pollen** - This gives a daily forecast of the pollen levels (low, high, or moderate), including trees, grass and weeds
- **Weather** - This gives a daily and hourly forecast of the temperature and humidity

Clinicians can view air quality data on the **Patient List**.

The **Patient Summary** displays a more detailed view of the patient's historic readings in graph or table form.
