title: Oxford Arthroplasty Early Recovery Score
---

Post-surgery care is key to successful recovery from any operation. The Oxford Arthroplasty Early Recovery Score (OARS) asks the patient about their post-surgery progress to assess any quality of life improvement. Their feedback is shared with their surgeon in order to help with the delivery of ongoing care.

## How it works

Patients answer a series of questions about how they feel post-surgery. To start, patients select the OARS module and click **Add**. For each question, they will choose from the following options:
- Strongly disagree
- Disagree
- Neither agree nor disagree
- Agree
- Strongly agree

At the end of the questionnaire, patients are assigned a score out of 100 which is shared with their care team. From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results. Reminders can also be set to help stay on track.
