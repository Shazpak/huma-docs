title: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)
---

Post-surgery care is key to successful recovery from any surgery for a patient. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire is a 
self-administered region-specific outcome instrument developed as a measure of self-rated upper-extremity disability and symptoms. 
Patient's feedback is shared with their care teams in order to provide the best post-surgery care.

## How it works

Patients are asked a series of multiple-choice questions about how they feel. The DASH consists mainly of a 30-item disability/symptom scale, 
scored 0 (no disability) to 100.
   
To start answering the questionnaire, patients select quickDash Questionnaire and click **Add**. 
From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results. 
Daily, weekly, or monthly reminders can be set to help stay on track.
