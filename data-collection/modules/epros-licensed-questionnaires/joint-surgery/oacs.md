title: Oxford Arthroplasty Early Change Score
---

Post-surgery care is key to successful recovery from any operation. The Oxford Arthroplasty Early Change Score (OACS) asks the patient about their post-surgery progress to assess any quality of life improvement. Their feedback is shared with their surgeon in order to help with the delivery of ongoing care.

## How it works

Patients answer a series of questions about their mobilty now compared to pre-surgery. To start, patients select the OACS module and click **Add**. For each question, they will choose from the following options:
- Much worse
- Worse
- The same
- Better
- Much Better

At the end of the questionnaire, patients are assigned a score from -50 to +50 which is shared with their care team. From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results. Reminders can also be set to help stay on track.
