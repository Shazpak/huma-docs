Post-surgery care is key to successful recovery from any operation. The Oxford Shoulder Score questionnaire is a quick and effective way to assess the outcome of all 
shoulder surgery with the exception of instability surgery. Their feedback is shared with their care teams in order to provide the best post-surgery care.

## How it works

Patients are asked a series of multiple-choice questions about how they feel and are assigned a score out of 48, where a higher score implies a greater degree of 
disability.
   
To start, patients select the **Oxford Shoulder Score** module and click **Add**. From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and 
also access all their previous results. Daily, weekly, or monthly reminders can be set to help stay on track.
