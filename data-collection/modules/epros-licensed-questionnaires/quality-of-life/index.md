title: Quality of Life
---

Quality of life is measured by a patient's ability to easily complete day to day tasks, such as walking, self-care, socialising, etc. Huma provides a collection of questionnaires to determine an individual's overall health in terms of their quality of life. Quality of life questionnaires allow care teams to work with patients to evaluate both positive and negative outcomes and make informed decisions about their ongoing healthcare.

These questionnaires are often utilised to collect outcomes from patients after receiving specific treatments. 

## How it works

Questionnaires are presented as a collection of subjective questions that assess levels of health in daily functions. That data is shared with care teams in the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and responses that might require prioritisation.
