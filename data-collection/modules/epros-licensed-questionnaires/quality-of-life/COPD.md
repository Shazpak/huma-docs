title: COPD (CAT)  Assessment Test
---
The COPD assessment test is a licensed questionnaire where patients make a self-assessment about their current state of well being to help their care team to asses the impact Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is having on their daily life. 
It is also a valuable tool in research that could be used to measure, compare and value health status across disease areas.

## How it works

Patients answer questions about coughing, breathlessness and their levels of activity. Questions are scored on a scale from 1-5 which is shared with care teams via the Clinician Portal.

To start, patients select the COPD module and click **Add**. When they have answered all the questions, they will be assigned a score that is shared with their care team. From within the module, patients can view their progress in a graph and also access all their previous results. Daily, weekly, or monthly reminders can be set to help stay on track.
