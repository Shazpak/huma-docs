title: Mobility
---

A patient's level of mobility determines how easily they are able to move around in their environment. Huma's mobility questionnares help to assess the condition of a patient in terms of their mobility and to transmit this information to their care teams.

## How it works

The questionnaires ask questions about how the patient feels in terms of their ease of mobility. Results are shared with care teams via the Clinician Portal where they can look for trends and prioritise accordingly.
