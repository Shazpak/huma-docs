# Welcome
Welcome to the Huma knowledge base. It explains the suite of products used in the delivery of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM).

Huma provides digital-first care by facilitating the journey of data from patients to care teams. Humaâ€™s 'Hospital at Home' technology collects real-world patient data remotely and connects patients and clinical teams. This can enable greater access to care from any location and improve efficiency for clinicians. 

The [Huma App](./huma-app/index.md) collects the data and delivers it to care and research teams via the [Clinician Portal](./clinician-portal/index.md). Both the app and the portal are set-up and configured via the [Admin Portal](./admin-portal/index.md). 

This knowledge base explains the features and tools included in each of the Huma products and describes how to complete the different tasks necessary for the successful completion of a monitoring programme. 

The Huma platform is used by:
- **Administrators**: Internal Huma users who will build and configure the technical structures (Organisations and Deployments) for healthcare or research organisations.
- **Care teams**: Doctors, nurses or allied health professionals users who will use Huma to view and assess patients.
- **Patients**: Users who will be submitting their data for assessment and feedback.
