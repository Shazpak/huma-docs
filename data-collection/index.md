# Welcome
Welcome to the Huma knowledge base. The following documentation is to explain the suite of products used in the delivery of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM).

Huma provides digital-first care by facilitating the journey of data from patients to care teams. Humaâ€™s hospital-at-home technology collects real-world patient data remotely, connecting patients and clinical teams, enabling greater access to care from any location and improving efficiency for clinicians. 

The collection of data is done via the [Huma App](./huma-app/index.md), delivery to care and research teams is done via the [Clinician Portal](./clinician-portal/index.md) and both are set up and configured via the [Admin Portal](./admin-portal/index.md). 

The aim of this documentation is to explain the features and tools included in each of the Huma products and how to complete the different tasks necessary for the successful completion of the monitoring programme. 

This knowledge base is for:
- **Administrators**: Internal Huma users who will build and configure the healthcare or research institute's Organisations and Deployments.
- **Care teams**: Doctors, nurses or allied health professionals users who will use Huma to view and assess patients.
- **Patients**: Users who will be submitting their data for assessment and feedback.
