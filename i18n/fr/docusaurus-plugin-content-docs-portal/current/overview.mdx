# Overview

Huma is working with various NHS trusts and global healthcare systems to bring connected care to patients and clinicians. Our solution helps care teams monitor patients remotely, providing early intervention opportunities and helping avoid unnecessary hospital admissions. Huma gives the information needed to guide patients through their care plan.

Navigating the Care Portal
-------------------------------

##### Homepage

When you first log in, your patient list will be sorted by 'Last updated' as default. 'Last updated' sorting is based on patients who have recently uploaded new information. You can sort your patient list by name, date of birth, last updated or priority.

You can also filter your patient list by their status -- e.g. those who require admission, those who you need to continue to monitor, or those who are currently inpatients, the number of symptoms they have, their blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature readings.

[![Navigating the Care Portal](https://info.huma.com/hubfs/Navigationg%20the%20HCP%20Portal-1.png "Navigating the Care Portal")](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/4899239/Navigationg%20the%20HCP%20Portal-1.png)

##### Patient status

The patient status is set to 'Continue Monitoring' by default. You can change the status of a patient by clicking the three dots sign on the far right.

If you are concerned about a patient, you can change their status to 'Flagged' or 'Needs admission'.

'Inpatient', 'Recovered' and 'Deceased' statuses should be used if a patient is no longer part of the active remote monitoring. These three statuses will indicate that the patient has been discharged from the programme.

If you select 'Continue monitoring', 'Flagged' and/or 'Needs admission' statuses, this should move all patients that are being actively monitored to the top of your list, and move all patients discharged from the programme to the bottom of your list.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If a discharged patient enters new information in the app, in line with default 'Any status' and 'Priority' sorting, the patient will appear at the top of your list with a purple 'New data' icon. It is important to ask discharged patients to stop entering new data and to delete the application from their phone.

Invites and permissions
-----------------------

##### Setting permissions

There are four default roles on the platform:

Admin -- any team member invited as Admin by another Admin, with full access to the platform. This includes inviting and removing staff members, along with adding new roles when needed.

Deployment staff -- any team member invited by an Admin or Access controller, with a restricted access to the platform.

Organisation staff -- any team member invited by an Admin or Access controller or a fellow Organisation staff, with a restricted access to the platform.

Access controller -- any team member invited as Access controller by an Admin or a fellow Access controller, with a restricted access to the platform.

Appointments

This takes you to the history of previous online appointments

##### Patient dashboard

This module shows the patient's individual modules and their most recent health records, including questionnaires that the patient has completed. When you click on the module or questionnaire you will be taken to the individual results of the patient's entries.

Physiological parameter ranges are colour-coded in amber or red to assist in efficient prioritisation of patients. Any data entered that isn't highlighted in red or amber will not be flagged to you.

[![Patient dashboard](https://info.huma.com/hubfs/Patient%20dashboard.png "Patient dashboard")](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/4899239/Patient%20dashboard.png)

##### Patient profile

This module shows the patient's details and background information such as date of birth, gender, and email/phone number. You will have the ability to edit the information if needed and input Patient Identifier information, such as their NHS number. The clinician will also be able to filter the patients in the list by selecting 'My patients'.

[![Patient profile](https://info.huma.com/hubfs/Patient%20personal%20details.png "Patient profile")](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/4899239/Patient%20personal%20details.png)

##### Patient notes

Once you have reviewed a patient's new data submissions, you can enter a note and click 'Publish', which will act as confirmation of your review and will be saved with your initials, time and date stamps.

Once you have done this, the green icon appearing on the left side of the name of the patient on Patient List view will disappear, and the patient will no longer appear at the top of your list.

The patient will also receive a 'seen' message on their app to indicate that someone from the clinical team has seen and reviewed the data submissions.

Modules
-------

##### Questionnaires

When you select a questionnaire on the patient module overview page, you will be taken to the individual results of the patient's entries. Answers to the baseline questionnaire can be found here, such as smoking status, pre-existing conditions, medications, initial symptoms, and the time of onset.

[![Questionnaires](https://info.huma.com/hubfs/Questionnaires-1.png "Questionnaires")](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/4899239/Questionnaires-1.png)

##### Traffic light system

Some of the graphs will have a "traffic light system" to help you navigate through the patient's well being. The thresholds would be configured based on requirements per deployment.

##### Symptoms

Here, you can review the symptoms reported by the patient with time/date stamps and severity grading. You can scroll down the table to see the evolution of each individual symptom over time.

[![Symptoms](https://info.huma.com/hubfs/Symptoms.png "Symptoms")](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/4899239/Symptoms.png)

##### Telemedicine

You can call the patient directly from the dashboard at any time. To do so, click the 'call patient' button at the top right corner of the portal, then click confirm on the pop-up window. To enable calls, make sure your browser settings allow camera and microphone use.

You're able to minimise the window of the call, so you can take notes and view the patient's data, while continuing the conversation.

Use the button showing a microphone to mute the call, and the button showing a camera to enable the video recording.

You can also review the history of all of the previous calls by clicking on the phone icon on the left hand side of the panel. Please note that the dashboard will not store unanswered attempts or other unsuccessful calls.
