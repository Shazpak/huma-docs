### Homepage

When you first log in, your patient list will be sorted by 'Last updated' as default. 'Last updated' sorting is based on patients who have recently uploaded new information. You can sort your patient list by name, date of birth, last updated or priority.

You can also filter your patient list by their status -- e.g. those who require admission, those who you need to continue to monitor, or those who are currently inpatients, the number of symptoms they have, their blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature readings.

### Patient status

The patient status is set to 'Continue Monitoring' by default. You can change the status of a patient by clicking the three dots sign on the far right.

If you are concerned about a patient, you can change their status to 'Flagged' or 'Needs admission'.

'Inpatient', 'Recovered' and 'Deceased' statuses should be used if a patient is no longer part of the active remote monitoring. These three statuses will indicate that the patient has been discharged from the programme.

If you select 'Continue monitoring', 'Flagged' and/or 'Needs admission' statuses, this should move all patients that are being actively monitored to the top of your list, and move all patients discharged from the programme to the bottom of your list.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If a discharged patient enters new information in the app, in line with default 'Any status' and 'Priority' sorting, the patient will appear at the top of your list with a purple 'New data' icon. It is important to ask discharged patients to stop entering new data and to delete the application from their phone.
