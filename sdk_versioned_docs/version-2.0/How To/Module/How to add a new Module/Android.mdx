## How to create a new module

To create a new module it is required to create at least two classes. The module itself and it's
provider.

### Define Module class

To create a module class use [Module](../../../References/Module/Android/Module) interface to describe a
module.

There is a few sub interfaces that used across first party modules and adds to a ```Module```
interface.

* ```ModuleWithDetails``` adds a details action to open a screen with Module details. Default
  behaviour is provided thru a delegate and can be called
  with ```private val detailsDelegate by defaultDetailsDelegate(moduleConfigId)```
* ```ModuleWithInput``` adds an input action to open input screen. Default
  behaviour is not provided in ModuleKit library.

> **Note:** It is recommended to use abstract ```BaseModule``` class instead on ```Module``` to have
> the generic functionality in your module without extra code.

There are few others that are not used in specific use cases and can be checked
in [References](../../../References/Module/Android/Module)

### Create provider

Each module need to be created via provider. One provider can return multiple modules, so it you
have several custom modules, you can use one ```ModuleProvider```.

Let's create ```ModuleProvider``` provider:

```kotlin
class YourModuleProvider : ModuleProvider {

    override suspend fun provideModules(): List<Module> {
        return listOf(YourModule())
    }

    override suspend fun refreshData(): Boolean {
        //do module data refresh
        return true // or false if you failed to refresh the data
    }
}
```

Then register it ether via initializer or manager.

> **Note:** Recommended way

```kotlin
context.installHumaSdk {
    sdk {
        moduleKit {
            installModule(YourModuleProvider())
        }
    }
}
```

Or

```kotlin
HumaModuleKitMananger.getInstance().registerModuleProvider(YourModuleProvider())
```

### How to get it's instance back

To obtain your module instance you can access ```modules``` list directly to find it, or
use ```findModule``` function to search it based on predefined parameters.

> **Note:** Do not create module instances outside of your module provider, as there is many SDK
> features that can trigger module recreation. Also do not put heavy object inside module instance
> as it's kept in memory for easy and quick access.

## How to use Modules (AppKit)

As Modules library is build on to of ModuleKit, all interfaces and interactions are practically the
same. Modules library adds a layer between Huma Platform APIs and SDK. Also it provides a set of
additional delegates for Huma Specific user flows.
