# Android

In Huma SDK Module framework is split between to layers - SDK and AppKit. SDK layer called
ModuleKit, and AppKit - Modules.

* ModuleKit (SDK) is responsible for generic module architecture without any relation to APIs.
* Modules (AppKit) is build on ModuleKit and tailored to Huma Platforms APIs. It also provides
  generic user flow that is used in 1st party modules.

## How to use Module Kit

Most of the ModuleKit features are accessible thru it's manager that is available after SDK
initialization.

To get it's instance call

```kotlin
HumaModuleKitManager.getInstance()
```

In general, usual usecase include ```findModule``` function to find specific instance of a module.
Or accessing ```module``` list, or subscribe to it's ```moduleState```.

You can check the rest of the functions in this [HumaModuleKitManager](../../../References/Module/Android/Module)
