title: Unsuccessful logins and password changes

Security violations and suspicious login attempts are logged and available for review. User account disability is triggered on a pre-determined number of attempts. Password changes can be configured according to project security requirements. 
Password complexity is configurable by the customer. We have a forgotten password function which does not require assistance. We provide an admin account with customisable permissions.
