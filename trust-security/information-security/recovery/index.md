## Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plans (testing, frequency, audit, documentation)

Huma has robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans that are captured in the Quality Management System (QMS) in Greenlight Guru. These procedures detail how to respond in the event of an outage or disaster (note: the difference between an outage and a disaster is based on whether the incident is likely to be a long period outside of our acceptance period). 

These plans are tested on an annual basis using tabletop exercises with senior leadership to ensure there is a continual improvement. In addition, Huma performs back-ups on a regular basis (differential hourly, differential daily, full weekly). These back-ups are tested every 3 months to ensure their effectiveness. 
Huma is able to provide some documentation and evidence to the client, as Huma’s Information Security Management System documents all tabletop and technical testing conducted (security testing section).

The business continuity and disaster recovery plans meet the necessary regulatory guidelines, including:
1. ISO13485 certified quality management system with robust risk management plan that includes data security & protection, business continuity, disaster recovery, & implementation of corrective & preventive actions
2. NHS data security and protection toolkit certification (YGMA8)
3. DB0129: clinical risk management: its application in the Manufacture of Health IT systems
4. DB0160: clinical risk management: its application in the deployment & use of health IT systems
5. CyberEssentials+
6. ISO27001

Internal and external audits are performed on a regular basis. Whilst internal audits are conducted quarterly by Huma’s internal audit team, the external audits are conducted as part of our certifications (ISO13485). 
Huma also adheres to IEC62304 and security aspects for software development.
We have an RTO of 1 hour for service availability of huma products and default RPO of 1 hour however this is dependent on product and solution as it’s customisable.
