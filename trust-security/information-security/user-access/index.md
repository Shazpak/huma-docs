title: User access and 2-Factor authentication
---

Clinicians access patient-entered data via the Clinician Portal, which is a secure web-browser based URL. The Clinician Portal has at least one 'admin' user (set by the client), who can invite clinicians / users to the Portal via a secure email sent directly from the product. Access is only granted to those who have been invited. Once the user is registered, access to the Clinician Portal is controlled via a password and a 2-factor authentication mechanism. 
As for patients, a password and a two-factor authentication are also in place to register on and access the Patient App.
Single Sign-On (SSO) can also be supported if required.
