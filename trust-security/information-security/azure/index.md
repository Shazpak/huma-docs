Huma uses a robust Identity and Access Management Solution via the Azure Active Directory, a Microsoft solution. By adding and configuring any application with Azure AD, we can centralise this identity and access management whilst helping to better secure the environment.
Azure Active Directory provides a variety of security benefits, such as:
1. Holistic user management
2. SSO access to applications
3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
4. Conditional access
5. Multi-factor authentication (on-premises and cloud)
6. Security monitoring and reporting
