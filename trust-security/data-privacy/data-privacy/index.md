## Countries where patient data is stored (location of the servers) 

Huma takes its privacy and data protection compliance very seriously and aims to comply in all material respects with local privacy and data protection laws. Our practice is to use servers located in a region or country, but we retain the ability to tailor how we deliver the products and services to better align to customer needs and requirements. Huma are cloud agnostic, but have worked with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform and Oracle cloud.


## How is Huma endeavouring to ensure patient privacy protection? 

products are already compliant with UK and EU privacy law, including GDPR, plus HIPAA and the CCPA in the US and we are expanding our use of the internationally industry leading privacy compliance tool OneTrust, which includes global templates. We have implemented several robust, technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of patient personal data to globally recognised standards: for example, ISO 27001:2013, and we use global law firms for expert counsel on legislation in different countries. 


Over and above Huma’s privacy compliance culture, it’s important to acknowledge that compliance is not just adhering to the letter but also the spirit too. We always seek a close working relationship with our customer privacy teams to support their needs in protecting their particular patient data.

## How Huma guarantees that patients personal data  data is isolated (firewalled) from any pseudonymized data Reasons

The ability to view and/or access personal data is managed by user level access control. This means that Huma is able to carefully define which user has access to the entirety of the data in agreement with the customer's needs and scope, as well as in alignment with local regulation and laws.

## Reasons why Huma collects sensitive personal data 

Huma only collects sensitive personal data only under direction from and at the behest of the healthcare provider. As such, our lawful basis for processing comes under the healthcare’s lawful basis, which the healthcare provider obtains via its own consenting process.   
There are two exceptions to the above.  Firstly, Huma processes patient health data as a controller as required to comply with law and/or regulation. Secondly, whilst not the primary purpose to process health data, there may be a collateral need to process health data during the course of ensuring the proper technical, functional and operational performance of the platform. These two exceptions are covered in  easily digestible privacy notices to patients via the registration journey on the Huma patient app. 

## How data is used in the platform

The Huma patient app collects telephone numbers and/or the email address of patients during the registration process in order to allow further log-ins. The data is only visible to the patient’s healthcare provider or HCP within the Huma Clinician Portal and is not shared externally or viewable by the Huma team with the exception of a restricted few whose primary purpose is to ensure accurate functioning of the underlying technology GDPR super-users. 

Data is hosted securely on HDS compliant cloud-based servers within the EU, or within the country where applicable. Huma employs a serverless infrastructure who manages all physical servers, resources and networking hardware to enable all business logic and higher-level services. 

## Personal data breach

Huma’s Privacy team is immediately notified when a personal data incident or breach is detected. Huma’s Data Protection Officer oversees the incident response process to investigate and assess a personal data breach. This process includes, but is not limited to:

1. Containment
2. Root cause analysis
3. Mitigation
4. Remediation
5. Improvement cycle
6. Communication
7. Risk Assessment

The notification to a data protection authority is usually determined by the controller. Where this is Huma, determination is made by the Huma CPO/DPO. Where Huma acts as a processor, which is typical in its business dealings, the Privacy team will notify the customer controller without undue delay and within 72 hours.

## Patient Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI)

Huma’s product captures and hosts PII and PHI in accordance with data privacy regulations and with appropriate consent.

## Right to be forgotten, right to rectification etc

Patients are typically ‘off-boarded’ from the solution on request and no longer have access to the app at such time as their interaction with the solution is no longer needed. In addition, and to comply with privacy regulations, at any time the patient can delete any patient input data from the App.  Deletion is not an automated process, it is a tightly controlled manual process for data removal. Any request to delete sensitive data from the clinician portal would be escalated to the customer controller as it would be their responsibility to respond to that request.
