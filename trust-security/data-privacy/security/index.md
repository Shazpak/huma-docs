The Huma product is compliant from a privacy perspective in the US, UK and EU countries plus certain other countries, including Saudi Arabia. We always aim to adhere to best practices under GDPR and HIPAA guidance in all jurisdictions. We are expanding our use of OneTrust, which includes global templates for documentation. In addition, we will use global law firms for expert advice as needed, as well as various sources for current developments in data privacy legislation globally.
